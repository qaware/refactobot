= Refactobot - Automate code reorganizations in large Java codebases.

Moving or renaming individual classes is a no-brainer in today's IDEs. But what if you want to rename thousands of
classes in hundreds of packages? What if you want to reorganize an entire codebase into a new module structure?

Refactobot takes a codebase and a list of transformations, and automatically applies them to the codebase.
